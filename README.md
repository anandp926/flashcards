##FlashCard:A native quiz mobile application (Android and iOS)
A mobile application (`this application was tested only on Android device`) that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
This is the final assessment project (#p3) for Udacity's React Fundamentals course developed by me.
For the UI design used React-Native, created a store in Redux and used AsyncStorage for storing data.

##Installing / Getting started

yarn install && yarn start
```
